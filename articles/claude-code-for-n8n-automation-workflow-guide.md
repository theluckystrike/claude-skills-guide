## The Setup

You are building automation workflows with n8n, the open-source workflow automation tool with a visual editor and 400+ integrations. Claude Code can generate custom n8n nodes and workflow JSON, but it defaults to Zapier patterns or generates standalone scripts instead of n8n-compatible workflow definitions.

## What Claude Code Gets Wrong By Default

1. **Writes standalone Node.js scripts.** Claude generates Express servers or standalone scripts for automation. n8n uses a visual workflow with connected nodes — code goes into Code nodes or custom node packages, not standalone files.

2. **Uses Zapier webhook format.** Claude formats webhooks for Zapier's trigger format. n8n's Webhook node expects different headers and configuration, and workflows are triggered differently.

3. **Generates n8n workflow JSON incorrectly.** Claude tries to generate workflow JSON but gets the node connection format wrong. n8n's connection schema has specific `main: [[{ node, type, index }]]` formatting.

{% raw %}4. **Ignores n8n's expression syntax.** Claude hardcodes values in nodes. n8n uses `{{ $json.fieldName }}` expressions to reference data from previous nodes in the workflow chain.
## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the minimum setup required?

You need Claude Code installed (Node.js 18+), a project with a `CLAUDE.md` file, and the relevant toolchain for your project type (e.g., npm for JavaScript, pip for Python). The CLAUDE.md file should describe your project structure, conventions, and common commands so Claude Code can work effectively.

### How long does the initial setup take?

For a typical project, initial setup takes 10-20 minutes. This includes creating the CLAUDE.md file, configuring `.claude/settings.json` for permissions, and running a test task to verify everything works. Subsequent sessions start immediately because the configuration persists.

### Can I use this with a team?

Yes. Commit your `.claude/` directory and `CLAUDE.md` to version control so the entire team uses the same configuration. Each developer can add personal preferences in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-level) without affecting the project configuration. Review CLAUDE.md changes in pull requests like any other configuration file.

### What if Claude Code produces incorrect output?

First check that your CLAUDE.md accurately describes your project conventions. Incorrect or outdated context is the most common cause of wrong output. If the output is still wrong, provide feedback in the same session — Claude Code learns from corrections within a conversation. For persistent issues, add explicit rules to CLAUDE.md (e.g., "Always use single quotes" or "Never modify files in the config/ directory").

## The CLAUDE.md Configuration

```
{% raw %}
# n8n Workflow Automation

## Platform
- Automation: n8n (self-hosted or n8n.cloud)
- Custom nodes: TypeScript with @n8n/n8n-nodes-base
- Code nodes: JavaScript/Python in workflow
- API: n8n REST API for workflow management

## n8n Rules
- Workflows are node graphs with connections
- Reference previous node data: {{ $json.field }}
- Code node: JavaScript with items array input/output
- Custom nodes: implement INodeType interface
- Credentials: managed in n8n, not hardcoded
- Webhook trigger: /webhook/ path auto-configured
- Error handling: Error Trigger node for workflow failures

## Conventions
- Custom nodes in packages/nodes-custom/ directory
- Workflow JSON exported for version control
- Credentials stored in n8n, referenced by name
- Code nodes for data transformation between services
- Use expressions over Code nodes when possible
- Test with n8n's built-in execution preview
- Pin data on nodes for consistent testing

## Workflow Example

You want to create a custom n8n node for your internal API. Prompt Claude Code:

"Create a custom n8n node for our project management API. It should have operations for listing projects, creating a project, and updating project status. Include credential definition for API key authentication."

Claude Code should create a node class implementing `INodeType` with `description` defining properties, operations, and credentials, a `credentials` file defining the API key auth type, and an `execute` method that makes HTTP requests to your API based on the selected operation.

## Common Pitfalls

{% raw %}1. **Expression vs static value confusion.** Claude sets node parameters as static strings when they should be expressions referencing previous nodes. In n8n, use the `=` toggle on fields to switch to expression mode and reference `{{ $json.data }}`.

2. **Code node return format.** Claude returns plain objects from Code nodes. n8n Code nodes must return an array of items: `return items.map(item => ({ json: { ...item.json, newField: 'value' } }))`. Wrong format causes silent data loss.

3. **Webhook URL vs production URL.** Claude uses the test webhook URL in external service configurations. n8n has separate test and production webhook URLs — the test URL only works during manual execution, not for live triggers.
